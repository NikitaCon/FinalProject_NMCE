# FinalProject_NMCE
(I FORGOT TO ADD MY READ.ME FILE , THIS WAS UPLOADED ON DECEMBER 21ST)

This is my final project I developed on Visual Code Studio, I decided to make an employee record system so basically a list of details for employees that can be edited, deleted and updated, I got inspiration from this from a variety of YouTube videos and decided it would be easy to set up.
The app is designed for user to input data about a particular staff member into the system and display it while saving and displaying previous saved data inputted.
